Hello there!

Every new venture has to start somewhere, so I'll start this playground/ blog section of the website with a few of the reasons for its existence.

I want a place to document and share experiments, work in progress and nifty solutions to tricky problems. There is nothing quite as annoying as coming across a difficulty that I'm certain I faced and overcame at some point in the misty past and being unable to remember exactly what I did to sort it! I'd also like to keep track of discoveries made out and about in Sheffield and beyond (I'm pretty new to the city so there is a lot to explore!) And, of course I need SOMEWHERE to share photos of my dog.

His name is Toast and he's incredibly photogenic, as you can see!
