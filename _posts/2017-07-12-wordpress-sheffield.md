Working from home as a freelancer can, at times, feel a little isolating. Since moving to Sheffield 6 months ago I've been looking for ways to meet new people and make new connections and so, when the details of the [WordPress Sheffield meetup](https://www.meetup.com/wpsheffield/ "WordPress Sheffield meetup") popped up on my WordPress Dashboard, I thought I should go along and check it out!

Organisers [Make Do](https://www.makedo.net "Make Do") provided lots of food for thought (as well as actual food, the pizza was much appreciated) with a talk on Boilerplating Wordpress from Dave Green and Developer News Update from Kimb Jones.

As a fan of the Foundation front end framework, I use [Joints WP](http://jointswp.com "Joints WP") as a starting point for WordPress projects because it provides a skeleton theme with Foundation set up and ready to go. However, as Dave made clear, there is a lot more that can be done to streamline project set up with a boilerplate; I'm keen to look into this in the future, starting with using Grunt to run tasks like minifying CSS, Javascript and images.

I really enjoyed Kimb's news update - I've missed this kind of sharing of knowledge and interests while moving around and living in remote spots over the last couple of years. I was particularly interested to hear about [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org "Let's Encrypt"), an organisation that provides free website security certificates - 

>We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can. We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

I had no idea! This is something I'll definitely use in the future, particularly as SSL is becoming a consideration in search engine ranking. One thing to remember, however, is that unlike a traditional security certificate provider, Let's Encrypt won't verify website ownership.
